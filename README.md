#### Tech/Frameworks Used
##### - Python
##### - Django
##### - PostgreSQL
##### - Psycopg2
##### - Bootstrap
##### - PyCharm
##### - Heroku
<br>

#### Motivation
##### My inspiration for this app came from wanting to create something with simple styling and an app that focused more on functionality. I thought an app based around architectural design would allow me to incorporate innovative styling through photos. I really wanted to create a project using Python and Django because of the functionality it allows. I was impressed with how quickly I picked it up and how much I really enjoyed using it.

#### Functionality
##### Design: The design view also functions as the homepage. In this view you are able to view architectural photos. You are also able to click on the photos which will redirect you to a different view page that allows you to see a description along wit the original image and title.
##### Blog: The blog view allows you to see the title, category, and 400 characters of the blog post. If you click on the blog title, the browser will redirect you to view the full blog post along with comments at the bottom of the post. In this view, you are able to make a comment and psot it.
##### Admin: The admin view allows the admin to log in. Once the admin has logged in they are able to view posts and designs along with editing, deleting, and adding new ones.

#### Biggest Challenges
##### One of my biggest challenges during the creation of this app was setting up PostgreSQL and installing psycopg2 in the terminal. A lot of my obstacles also came from learning the difference between different versions of Python and Django and making sure that the version I am currently have installed is the one I am writing into my code. Heroku was definitely one of my biggest challenges and took up a couple of days to deploy and to get the server on Heroku working with the app.
